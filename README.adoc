== Arquillian Governor Extension

Arquillian Governor Extension and the implementations which use its API give 
you the possibility to programmatically choose what test methods of your 
Arquillian tests are going to be executed and what are going to be skipped 
by putting your custom annotations on the test methods.

The resolution of the test method execution is done during the test class 
execution in `BeforeClass` phase.

Currenly, there are two implementations which use API of the Arquillian 
Governor extension - Arquillian JIRA Governor extension and Arquillian Skipper extension.

=== Configuration of Arquillian Governor extension

Arquillian Governor extension is an extension on top of which all other concrete _governors_ are 
built. When you provide some custom Governor implementation, this extension is automatically behind it. 
Arquillian Governor base implementation is configured by putting the following extension definition
into `arquillian.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="governor">
</extension>
----

Possible properties for `governor` extension:

|===
|Configuration property|Description|Default value|Possible values

|ignore
|No test execution resolution will be done. All test methods, even annotated with `@Governor` annotation, will be executed as normally.
|false
|true / false
|ignoreOnly
|Fully qualified class name of `@Governor` annotation to ignore. When such annotation is put on a test method, no test execution resolution will be performed.
|empty string
|Fully qualified class name of an annotation you want to ignore.

|===

== Arquillian JIRA Governor Extension

In order to use JIRA Governor extension, you have to put this dependency into your Arquillian test Maven build:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-governor-jira</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>    
----

As stated previously, JIRA Governor has the base implementation automatically bundled in it so you can configure `governor` extension as well.

=== Configuration of Arquillian JIRA Governor Extension

Arquillian JIRA Governor extension is configured by putting the following extension definition into `arquillian.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="governor-jira">
</extension>
----

Possible properties for `governor-jira` extension:

|===
|Configuration property|Description|Default value|Possible values

|username
|your JIRA user name. This user name will be used to log in to JIRA instance
|this property has to be set and has to be non-empty, otherwise it fails
|
|password
|your JIRA password. This password will be used to log in to JIRA instance
|this property has to be set and has to be non-empty, otherwise it fails
|
|server
|JIRA server to connect to
|https://issues.jboss.org
|any address which is valid URI and URL
|force
|Even JIRA status is Unresolved or Open, this test method will be executed anyway
|false
|true / false
|closePassed
|If you force the execution for some test method which has status as 'Unresolved' or 'Open' and this test succeeds and this property is set to true, JIRA issue on `server` will be automatically resolved as 'Done' and appropriate message about the issue resolving will be submitted to that JIRA issue as a comment posted by `username`.
|false
|true / false
|closingMessage
|Message which appears as a comment on a JIRA issue which was automatically closed.
|This JIRA issue was automatically closed by %s with Arquillian Jira Governor extension. ('%s' is replaced by +username+ property).
|Any string.

|===

Due to security reasons, when you do not specify `server` and `username` or `password` properties in `arquillian.xml` 
for JIRA Governor, this extension looks for system properties `jira.governor.server`, `jira.governor.username` and 
`jira.governor.password` respectively.

You can set properties `force` and `closePassed` by system properties `jira.governor.force` and `jira.governor.closepassed` by setting them to "true" or "false".

=== Usage

Let's have this test case:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class TestCase
{
    @Test
    @Jira("ARQ-1907")
    public void test()
    {
        // this test will be run
        // because ARQ-1907 is 'Done'
        // so we assume that this test has to pass as well
    }

    @Test
    @Jira("ARQ-5000")
    public void test2()
    {
        // when this JIRA exists and its status is 'Unresolved' / 'Open'
        // this test method will be skipped because you assume that
        // if you run it, it would fail
    }

}
----

=== Automatic closing of your JIRA issues

If some JIRA issue is unresolved, normally, it would be skipped from 
execution. However if you force it to execute by `force` flag on `@Jira` annotation, and this test method
passes with success, if you set property `closePassed` in your `arquillian.xml`, that JIRA will be 
automatically marked as `Done` on JIRA server.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class AutomaticClosingTestCase
{
    @Test
    @Jira("ARQ-5000", force = true)
    public void automaticClosingTest)
    {   
        // when this JIRA exists and its status is 'Unresolved' / 'Open'
        // and you have forced its execution and you set 'closePassed'
        // property in arquillian.xml to 'true',
        // when this test method succeeds, it automatically resolves 
        // respective JIRA issue as 'Done'
    } 
}
----

=== Detectors for environment related to JIRA issues
JIRA issues can be related to some specific environments, e.g. operation system, java implementation, timezone...
In that case you can create your custom detectors which are necessary to reproduce the specified issue.
If those detectors are not met then this issue will not force the test method to be skipped.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class IssuesWithConditionalTestCases
{
    @Test
    @Jira(value = "ARQ-1000", detector = @Detector(Windows.class))
    public void conditionalTest()
    {
        // This test case will be executed on all operation systems except for Windows.
        // If the current OS is Windows then the status of JIRA issue will be checked.
    }

    @Test
    @Jira(value = "ARQ-2000",
            detector = @Detector(value = { OpenJDK.class, Java_7.class }, strategy = And.class)
    )
    public void multipleConditionsAndStrategyTest()
    {
        // This is similar example with more detectors and merging strategy.
    }
}
----

== Arquillian GitHub Governor Extension

In order to use GitHub Governor extension, you have to put this dependency into your Arquillian test Maven build:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-governor-github</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

As stated previously, GitHub Governor has the base implementation automatically bundled in it so you can configure `governor` extension as well.

=== Configuration of Arquillian GitHub Governor Extension

Arquillian GitHub Governor extension is configured by putting the following extension definition into `arquillian.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="governor-github">

|false
|true / false
|closePassed
|If you force the execution for some test method which has status as 'Open' and this test succeeds and this property is set to true, GitHub issue on `server` will be automatically resolved as 'Closed' and appropriate message about the issue resolving will be submitted to that GitHub issue as a comment posted by `username`.
|false
|true / false
|closingMessage
|Message which appears as a comment on a GitHub issue which was automatically closed.
|This GitHub issue was automatically closed by %s with Arquillian GitHub Governor extension. ('%s' is replaced by +username+ property). If you are using token and username is not set, as of now, it will be set to "unknown"
|Any string.

|===

Due to security reasons, when you do not specify `server` and `username` or `password` properties in `arquillian.xml`
for GitHub Governor, this extension looks for system properties `github.governor.repository`, `github.governor.repositoryuser`, `github.governor.token`, `github.governor.username` and
`github.governor.password` respectively.

You can set properties `force` and `closePassed` by system properties `github.governor.force` and `github.governor.closepassed` by setting them to "true" or "false".

=== Usage

Let's have this test case:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class TestCase
{
    @Test
    @GitHub("1")
    public void test()
    {
        //...
    }

}
----

=== Automatic closing of your GitHub issues

If some GitHub issue is unresolved, normally, it would be skipped from
execution. However if you force it to execute by `force` flag on `@GitHub` annotation, and this test method
passes with success, if you set property `closePassed` in your `arquillian.xml`, that GitHub will be
automatically marked as `Closed` on GitHub server.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class AutomaticClosingTestCase
{
    @Test
    @GitHub(value = "2", force = true)
    public void automaticClosingTest)

----

== Arquillian Redmine Governor Extension

In order to use Redmine Governor extension, you have to put this dependency into your Arquillian test Maven build:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-governor-redmine</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

As stated previously, Redmine Governor has the base implementation automatically bundled in it so you can configure `governor` extension as well.

=== Configuration of Arquillian Redmine Governor Extension

To use this extension you need to enable Redmine rest api like in image below:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arquillian/arquillian-governor/master/redmine/enable-api.png[]

And also will need an *apikey*. The apikey can be found in your user's account, see image below:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arquillian/arquillian-governor/master/redmine/get-your-api.png[]

Arquillian Redmine Governor extension is configured by putting the following extension definition into `arquillian.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="governor-redmine">
        <property name="server">http://localhost:10083/</property>
        <property name="apikey">42f0c893f65fc65cab6ddd8eaad4c5029799a7ab</property>
</extension>
----

Possible properties for `governor-redmine` extension:

|===
|Configuration property|Description|Default value|Possible values

|server
|The Redmine server address.
|this property has to be set and has to be non-empty, otherwise it fails if no property is set
|Any string.
|apikey
|your redmine user apikey.
|this property has to be set and has to be non-empty, otherwise it fails if no property is set
|Any string.
|force
|Even if issue status is Open, this test method will be executed anyway
|false
|true / false
|closePassed
|If you force the execution for some test method which has status as *not* 'closed' and this test succeeds and this property is set to true, Redmine issue on `server` will be automatically resolved as *'Closed'* and appropriate message about the issue resolving will be submitted to that Redmine issue as a comment posted by `username`.
|false
|true / false
|closingMessage
|Message which appears as a comment on a Redmine issue which was automatically *closed*.
|This Redmine issue was automatically closed by %s with Arquillian Redmine Governor extension. ('%s' is replaced by +username+ property).
|Any string.
|openFailed
|If this test fails and this property is set to true, Redmine issue on `server` will be automatically resolved as 'New' and appropriate message about the issue reopened will be submitted to that Redmine issue as a comment posted by `username`.
|false
|true / false
|openingMessage
|Message which appears as a comment on a Redmine issue which was automatically *opened*. The stacktrace will be also appended to opening message.
|This Redmine issue was automatically opened by %s with Arquillian Redmine Governor extension. ('%s' is replaced by +username+ property).
|Any string.

|===

Due to security reasons, when you do not specify `server` and `apikey` properties in `arquillian.xml`
for Redmine Governor, this extension looks for system properties `redmine.governor.server` and `redmine.governor.apikey`.

You can set properties `force`, `closePassed` and `openFailed` by system properties `redmine.governor.force`, `redmine.governor.closepassed` and `redmine.governor.openFailed` by setting them to "true" or "false".

=== Usage

Let's have this test case:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class TestCase
{
    @Test
    @Redmine("1")
    public void test()
    {
        //...
    }

}
----

=== Automatic closing of your Redmine issues

If some Redmine issue is unresolved, normally, it would be skipped from
execution. However if you force it to execute by `force` flag on `@Redmine` annotation, and this test method
passes with success, if you set property `closePassed` in your `arquillian.xml`, that issue will be
automatically marked as `Closed` on Redmine server.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class AutomaticClosingTestCase
{
    @Test
    @Redmine(value = "2", force = true)
    public void automaticClosingTest)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

Here is an issue closed by Governor Redmine:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arquillian/arquillian-governor/master/redmine/closed.png[]

=== Close order

Redmine can be configured to have a workflow for issue transitions. In some cases this workflow *does not* allow closing issues for some issue statuses.

Imagine you have a customised workflow for closing issues, e.g 'New' -> 'Executing' -> 'close', then you have to provide statuses id order so governor redmine can close your issues.

In the example above the issue have to go to 'executing'(id 2) before going to 'close'(id 5). Just add 'closeOrder' property in arquillian:


[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="governor-redmine">
        <property name="closeOrder">2, 5</property>
</extension>
----

NOTE: You can retrieve issue status id in 'REDMINE_URL/issue_statuses.xml' address.

=== Automatic opening of your Redmine issues

If some Redmine issue is *closed* it will be executed and if your test fails nothing will be updated on Redmine server. However if you set `openFailed` flag on `@Redmine` annotation or in `arquillian.xml` to true, and this test method
fails then that issue will be automatically marked as `New` on Redmine server.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class AutomaticOpeningTestCase
{
    @Test
    @Redmine(value = "3", openFailed = true)
    public void automaticOpeningTest)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

Here is an issue opened by Governor Redmine:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arquillian/arquillian-governor/master/redmine/openFailed.png[]

=== Setting up Redmine locally

The easiest way to run redmine locally is to use this docker image: https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine

IMPORTANT: before you create any project go to *Administration* menu and click on *Load default configuration*. see https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/issues/92[this issue^] for more details.

== Arquillian Governor Skipper extension

This extension simply skips test methods which are annotated with `@TestSpec`. In order to use this extension, put this into `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-governor-skipper</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-recorder-reporter-impl</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Configuration of this extension is done via `governor-skipper` qualifier:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="governor-skipper">
    <property name="plainAdoc">plain_table.adoc</property>
</extension>
----

This extension introduces just one annotation you put on your test method. Let's see it in action:

[source,java]
----
    @Test
    @TestSpec(
        author = "Stefan Miklosovic",
        assertion = "this test should pass",
        feature = "tests if true returns true",
        issue = "ARQ-1",
        prerequisites = "have java",
        status = Status.AUTOMATED,
        steps = "some steps in order to execute this",
        test = "what does this step do"
        )
    public void someTest() {
        Assert.assertTrue(true);
    }
----

If `status` is `Status.MANUAL`, test method will be skipped from the execution. The generated report gives you 
better overview of your test cases, what they do, which methods are automated and which you have to execute manually.

If `plainAdoc` property is used, a report will be saved to plain asciidoc table as well. A report will be 
added into the tree of Arquillian Report output file in every case.

|===
|Configuration property|Description|Default value|Possible values

|plainAdoc
|name of file where plain asciidoc table will be stored
|if this is not set, report to plain adoc will be skipped
|

|===

== Arquillian Governor Ignore extension

This extension simply ignores (skips) test methods which are listed in arquillian.xml. In order to use this extension, put this into `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-governor-ignore</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Configuration of this extension is done via `governor-ignore` qualifier:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="governor-ignore">
    <property name="expression">com\.foobar\.[.]*</property>
    <property name="methods">org.acme.foo.ListTest#testStrFilter,org.bar.boo.QwertTest#testFoo</property>
    <property name="methods_1">org.arquillian.test.governor.ignore.IgnoreTest#testIgnored</property>
</extension>
----

The "expression" property is a regexp to which it matches simple method's fqn (<class-name>#<method-name>).

The "methods" property contains a list of simple fqn's, separated by comma (,),
where any property starting with "methods_" is a separate simple fqn.

Of course all properties are optional. But in order to ignore something, at least one must be defined. ;-)

== How do I implement my own Governor?

Glad you asked. Because of Arquillian Governor base extension, you are welcome to code 
your own test method execution resolver as we did with Arquillian JIRA governor extension.

The governor annotation you want to put on your test method (as we did with `@Jira`) have 
to be annotated with +@Governor+ annotation. `@Jira` annotation looks like this:

[source,java]
----
@Governor // <--- you have to annotate your own annotation with this
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ ElementType.METHOD })
@Documented
public @interface Jira
{
    String value() default "";

    boolean force() default false;
}
----

`force` field is optional. This is only specific for JIRA extension, maybe your governor will use something 
completely else.

Once you have your governor annotation in your extension, you have to write your own https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-core/blob/master/test/spi/src/main/java/org/jboss/arquillian/test/spi/execution/TestExecutionDecider.java[TestExecutionDecider]. `TestExecutionDecider` implementation has to be registered as a service to your Arquillian extension like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MyLoadableExtension implements LoadableExtension
{
    @Override
    public void register(ExtensionBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.service(TestExecutionDecider.class, MyTestExecutionDecider.class);
        builder.service(GovernorProvider.class, BugzillaProvider.class);
    }
}
----

The usage of this SPI is fully explained in official http://arquillian.org/blog/2015/01/26/arquillian-core-1-1-6-Final/[Arquillian Core 1.1.6 release blog post].

As described above, you have to register as a service your own `GovernorProvider` which provides the decoding annotation like this:

[source,java]
----
public class BugzillaProvider implements GovernorProvider
{
    @Override
    public Class<? extends Annotation> provides()
    {
        return Bugzilla.class;
    }
}
----

By doing so, you can use `@Bugzilla` annotations on your test methods. `@Bugzilla` annotation has to be itself annotated with `@Governor` annotation the same way as `@Jira` annotation is.

Finally, you have to observe `ExecutionDecisionEvent` where you have to decide if the annotation in this event which is put on some test method is going to be executed or not.

The example how we did this all for Jira Governor is in class `JiraTestExecutionDecider`.

This is the minimal scenario. Of course, your resolution can be done in a completely different way, you could resolve it against database, file, properties or what ever. It is up to you.

== How do I build this extension?

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

== Releasing new version

In order to release new version, execute following Maven command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean release:prepare release:perform
----

Then:

0. Run test projects in `tests` directory and bump version of governor dependency in them to the to-be-released one
1. Verify the build from staging repository
2. Make sure all JIRAs are closed
3. Release version in JIRA and create next version if not available
4. Promote the build to the stable Maven repository
5. Push commits and tag created by +maven-release-plugin+ to the repository.
